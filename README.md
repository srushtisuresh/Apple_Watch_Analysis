# Apple_Watch_Analysis
The summary and conclusion are mentioned in the project jupyter notebook (took advantage of the markdown files). I 
use apple watch 24/7 and everytime I took a walk or exercised, the watch predicted the type of activity I might be doing. This encouraged me to go further
into the dataset and explore how an apple watch work behind the screens.
